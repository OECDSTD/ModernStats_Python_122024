## Python Beginner Course: Functions and GDP Growth Calculation

### 1. Introduction to Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing your code, making it more readable, and reducing repetition.

### 2. Basic Syntax of Functions
The basic structure of a Python function is:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Code block
    return value
```

#### Key Components:
1. **`def`**: Used to define a function.
2. **`function_name`**: The name of the function (should be descriptive).
3. **`parameters`**: Inputs to the function (optional).
4. **`return`**: Used to output the result (optional).

### 3. Why Use Functions?
- **Code Reusability**: Write once, use multiple times.
- **Modularity**: Divide a program into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Improved Readability**: Clear and organized code.

### 4. Example Dataset and Problem Statement
We are provided with a dataset of annual GDP values for various countries. The task is to:
1. Extract GDP data for a specific country.
2. Calculate year-over-year GDP growth using a function.
3. Handle missing or invalid data gracefully.

#### GDP Growth Formula:
To calculate GDP growth:

\[ \text{Growth Rate} = \frac{\text{GDP}_{\text{current year}} - \text{GDP}_{\text{previous year}}}{\text{GDP}_{\text{previous year}}} \times 100 \]

### 5. Writing a Function for GDP Growth Calculation
Below is an example of a Python function to calculate GDP growth.

```python
def calculate_growth(data, country):
    """
    Calculates year-over-year GDP growth for a given country.

    Args:
        data (list): List of dictionaries containing GDP data.
        country (str): The country to calculate growth for.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    # Filter data for the specific country
    country_data = [row for row in data if row["Country"] == country]

    # Sort data by year
    country_data.sort(key=lambda x: x["Year"])

    # Calculate GDP growth
    print(f"Year-over-Year GDP Growth for {country}:")
    for i in range(1, len(country_data)):
        prev_gdp = country_data[i - 1]["GDP"]
        curr_gdp = country_data[i]["GDP"]

        # Check for missing values
        if prev_gdp is None or curr_gdp is None:
            print(f"Year {country_data[i]['Year']}: Data unavailable")
            continue

        # Calculate growth rate
        growth_rate = ((curr_gdp - prev_gdp) / prev_gdp) * 100
        print(f"Year {country_data[i]['Year']}: {growth_rate:.2f}%")

# Example Data

data = [
    {"Year": 2020, "Country": "Norway", "GDP": 1000},
    {"Year": 2021, "Country": "Norway", "GDP": 1100},
    {"Year": 2022, "Country": "Norway", "GDP": None},  # Missing value example
    {"Year": 2020, "Country": "Portugal", "GDP": 800},
    {"Year": 2021, "Country": "Portugal", "GDP": 850},
]

# Test the function
calculate_growth(data, "Norway")
calculate_growth(data, "Portugal")
```

### 6. Practice Task
1. Modify the `calculate_growth` function to return a list of growth rates instead of printing them.
2. Write another function `average_growth(data, country)` to calculate the average GDP growth for a country.

### 7. Solution Example
#### Function to Return Growth Rates:
```python
def calculate_growth(data, country):
    """
    Calculates year-over-year GDP growth for a given country.

    Args:
        data (list): List of dictionaries containing GDP data.
        country (str): The country to calculate growth for.

    Returns:
        list: List of year-over-year GDP growth rates.
    """
    # Filter data for the specific country
    country_data = [row for row in data if row["Country"] == country]

    # Sort data by year
    country_data.sort(key=lambda x: x["Year"])

    # Calculate GDP growth
    growth_rates = []
    for i in range(1, len(country_data)):
        prev_gdp = country_data[i - 1]["GDP"]
        curr_gdp = country_data[i]["GDP"]

        # Check for missing values
        if prev_gdp is None or curr_gdp is None:
            growth_rates.append(None)
            continue

        # Calculate growth rate
        growth_rate = ((curr_gdp - prev_gdp) / prev_gdp) * 100
        growth_rates.append(growth_rate)

    return growth_rates
```
