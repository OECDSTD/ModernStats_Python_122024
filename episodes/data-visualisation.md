## Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore how to create visualizations of your data using three popular Python libraries:

- **Matplotlib** is a foundational library for creating static visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of charts, such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more. While it offers great flexibility, it requires more code for customization, making it best suited for basic to moderately complex visualizations.

- **Seaborn** builds on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn comes with several built-in themes and color palettes, and it simplifies many common tasks, such as visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables. It's especially powerful when working with Pandas DataFrames and when creating plots like boxplots, heatmaps, and pair plots.

- **Plotly** is a modern, interactive graphing library that allows you to create beautiful and interactive web-based visualizations. It is designed for creating visualizations that allow users to zoom, hover, and interact with the chart dynamically. Plotly is particularly useful for creating dashboards, 3D plots, and other interactive visualizations that engage users in exploring the data.
